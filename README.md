# Assignment1_DigitalNotebook
Juan P Morales

Overview

This repository is my personal backend development workspace for the semester. I’m using it to document everything I learn, the projects I build, and the resources I find helpful along the way. It’s basically a digital notebook where I can track my progress as I move through the different units of the course. I also want to use this space to get comfortable with Git and GitHub, since version control is such an essential part of being a developer. As the semester goes on, I’ll keep expanding this repository with new folders, notes, and examples that reflect my learning journey.

Learning Objectives

My main goal for this course is to become confident in backend development. I want to understand how to use Git effectively for version control and collaboration, and I plan to get comfortable writing backend scripts that solve real problems. I’m also excited to learn more about creating RESTful APIs and exploring more advanced scripting concepts like automation, testing, and error handling. Overall, I want to strengthen my problem-solving skills, become more independent as a coder, and build a solid foundation for future projects or internships in backend development.

How I Plan to Use This Repository

I plan to use this repository as a central place to organize all of my backend work this semester. I’ll record what I learn and reflect on my progress in a file called learning-log.md. I’ll also collect useful tutorials, documentation links, and other resources in a file called resources.md so I can easily revisit them later. Each course unit will have its own folder where I can store notes, practice code, and assignments. I’ll keep track of everything through meaningful Git commits to get into the habit of good version control practices. By the end of the semester, I hope this repository will show how much I’ve grown as a developer and serve as a helpful reference for future projects.
